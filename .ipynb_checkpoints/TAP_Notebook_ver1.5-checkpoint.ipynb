    "1. Upgraded folder path selection application\n",
    "2. Upgraded dataset management (less moving parts for end-user)\n",
    "3. output changed from tif -> png\n",
    "4. Added tap-correction function for missing taps (Still in progress - taken out for now)\n",
    "5. Added plate column to evaluate plate-discrepancies\n",

    "## Beginner Essentials:\n",
    "1. Shift-Enter to run each cell. After you run, you should see an output \"done step #\". If not, an error has occured\n",
    "2. When inputting your own code/revising the code, make sure you close all your quotation marks '' and brackets (), [], {}.\n",
    "3. Don't leave any commas (,) hanging! (make sure an object always follows a comma. If there is nothing after a comma, remove the comma!\n",
    "4. Learning to code? Each line of code is annotated to help you understand how this code works!\n",
